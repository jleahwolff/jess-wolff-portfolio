# Imports
## TailwindCSS
    - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

## Craco
    - Ran into issues with craco uploading with Netlify. Fixed some underlying bugs in the code, spent several attempts re-confguring my scripts and the Netlify build settings, but after several variations, the fix all was npm uninstalling tailwindcss, autoprefixer and postcss, and reinstalling making sure everything was postcss7 compatible. Here's the link that led me to that:
